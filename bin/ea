# Quick shortcut to an editor.
#
# This means that as I travel back and forth between editors, hey, I don't have
# to re-learn any arcane commands. Neat. 
#
# NOTE: maybe this only works for sublime, but ea is like e but adds it to your open editor
#
# USAGE:
#
#   $ ea
#   # => opens the current directory in your currently open editor
#
#   $ ea .
#   $ ea /usr/local
#   # => opens the specified directory in your currently openeditor
